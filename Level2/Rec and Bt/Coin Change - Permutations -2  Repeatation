1. You are given a number n, representing the count of coins.
2. You are given n numbers, representing the denominations of n coins.
3. You are given a number "amt".
4. You are required to calculate and print the permutations of the n coins (same coin can be used again any number of times) using which the amount "amt" can be paid.

Note -> Use the code snippet and follow the algorithm discussed in question video. The judge can't force you but the intention is to teach a concept. Play in spirit of the question.
